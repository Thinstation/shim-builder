Error=CRUX discourages installing python packages via pip
 directly. This practice can lead to unpredictable behaviour
 while using the official ports system.

 Instead of using pip, try looking for your desired package
 inside your available repositories with e.g. 'prt-get search
 MODULENAME'.
 You might also want to see if a CRUX user published a port for
 your desired package on the official ports database.

 If it's not available it is advisable to create one yourself and
 control the package with the ports system.
 However, if you don't wish to create your own package(s), you can
 create a virtual environment using '/usr/bin/python3 -m venv
 path/to/venv'.
 Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
 sure you have python3-virtualenv installed.
